/*

2. Let

*/

/*
VAR 
can be used throughout your whole program
*/

/*LET
can only be used in the scope where it is declared
*/

/*CONST
is a variable that should never change, it cannot be changed
*/

//STORING VARIABLES WITH ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
/*
Difference between declaring and assigning variable

var a ;
here a is declared
var b = 2;

The equal sign is the assignment operator which means 2 is assigned to b, or b is 2 in this code

a = 7
 which means 7 is assigned to a, we don't need to declare a anymore because it has been declared above
*/

*/

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a ";

a = a + 1; //Output 5 + 1 = 6
b = b - 1; //Output 10 - 1 = 9
c = c + "  string"; // Output "I am a string "
